# Aim-the-Click-game
Aim the Click game is a tkinter aim clicking game

# Source code
Source code is not available yet, if you would like to get the source code you can message me and I will instantly give it to you.

# The goal of the game
The goal of the game is to click as many targets (green buttons) within the chosen time and set a record.  
If you set a record you will automatically be asked for your name to put on the leaderboard.  
Your record will be saved in an online database so everyone can see your achievement.  

# Why did I make this?
I made this because I was bored and wanted to improve my python skills.  
It ended up being a really fun project and I finished this within a few days and I am quite proud of it since I am still a beginner.  

# Easy to cheat
I know it is very easy to make a bot to search for the green buttons and let it click them (I already made one).  
And I also know it is very easy to solve however I am currently focussing on another project so I am not really bothered to make it anti-cheat right now.  
I think this is a great competetive game to play for a few times until you get bored (which will happen after playing it twice).  
If people really want to make bots and ruin the fun for the others, that is fine then I will make it anti-cheat and reset the leaderboard.

Or if you would like to practice making a bot but don't want to ruin others fun (Those people are the best) then make sure to open the program without internet
so it will give you the "Couldn't connect to the database" error, which means you can break the record and see what you can achieve with your bot without editing the leaderboard!
